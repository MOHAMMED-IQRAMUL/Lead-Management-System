Reflection:

The hardest part of this assignment was implementing secure JWT authentication with httpOnly cookies and making it work correctly across frontend and backend with CORS.
I also found server-side filtering logic challenging, as it required carefully parsing multiple operators for different field types.

Through this project, I learned a lot about structuring a full-stack application, setting up pagination, and handling deployment for both frontend and backend.

If I had one more day, I would improve the UI with better validation and error handling, and add more components to increase reliability.

Thank you for the opportunity â€” I look forward to your feedback!

Best regards,
Mohammed Iqramul
